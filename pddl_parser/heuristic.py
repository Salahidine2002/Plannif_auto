    Calculate a heuristic value based on the difference between the current state and the goal state.

    Args:
        state: The current state represented as a dictionary of variable-value pairs.
        act: The action being considered. This parameter might not be directly used in this simplistic heuristic but is included for compatibility.
        goal_pos: The positive goals as a dictionary of variable-value pairs that should be present for the goal to be achieved.
        goal_not: The negative goals as a dictionary of variable-value pairs that should not be present for the goal to be achieved.

    Returns:
        An integer representing the heuristic cost of reaching the goal state from the current state.
